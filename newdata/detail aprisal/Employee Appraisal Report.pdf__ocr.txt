THE ACADEMY FOR EDUCATIONAL DEVELOPMENT
EMPLOYEE APPRAISAL REPORT
INTRODUCTION
DEVELOPING AN EFFECTIVE EMPLOYEE APPRAISAL REPORT
This Employee Appraisal Report (EAR) is designed to achieve four important objectives relating to each
employee's professional development and continued employment at AED. These objectives are:
1. To assist each employee and their supervisor establish and agree upon performance objectives for the
employee's work during the upcoming year;
2. To clarify the supervisor's expectations and the employee's understanding of their responsibilities,
leading to maximum performance and high productivity;
3. To open a dialogue between the employee and the supervisor regarding the employee's expertise in
eleven fundamental job competencies necessary to be successful at AED; and,
4. To obligate both the employee and the supervisor to specific actions which are monitored throughout
the year, and which form the basis for the employee's final performance review at the end of the year.
The foundation of the EAR is the eleven job competencies (JCs) that are listed below. The majority of these JCs
are relevant to every job at AED. Under each JC, there are definitions describing activities and behaviors that
demonstrate proficiency in the respective JC. Together at the performance objective setting stage, the employee
and the supervisor will determine which JCs apply to the employee's job. These JCs reflect AED's values, and
proficiency in these activities is crucial to AED's mission. At the end of the year, each supervisor will rate the
employee in their ability to satisfactorily perform in the following JCs, which are applicable to their job:
Communication
Diversity
Job Knowledge
Productivity
Professionalism
Team Work
Business Principles
Corporate Wellness
Innovation
Leadership
Staff Development

BEGINNING OF THE YEAR ACTIVITIES
STEP 1:
INSTRUCTIONS FOR COMPLETING THE
EMPLOYEE APPRAISAL REPORT (EAR)
●
The employee locates the EAR on the AED portal under "AED Forms, Human Resources." S/he saves
the form as a Word document on his/her personal drive. The employee completes the performance
objectives and criteria for measurement in preparation for a discussion with the supervisor. These
objectives can be adapted from the employee's formal job description, work plan, contract, and/or
department goals. The criteria for measurement for each performance objective will indicate which job
competency or competencies it demonstrates, using the phrase [Demonstrating:].
The employee and the supervisor meet to formally agree on performance objectives and criteria for
measurement for the upcoming year. The performance objectives are recorded in SECTION I of the
EAR (please see the example below).
In SECTION II, the first 6 competencies apply to all jobs. During the goal setting meeting, the
supervisor and employee will determine which of the remaining 5 competencies apply to the
employee's job. This will be indicated by placing an "X" in the box in the column to the left of each
applicable competency.
Further training in this process is presented annually in the Washington, DC headquarters during the
AED workshop entitled "Setting Performance Goals". Those individuals unable to attend this
workshop will find the workshop outline on the AED portal under “Management Services, Human
Resources, Training.”
Performance Objective
Example: Performance Objective
Provide technical leadership in HIV/AIDS
activities related to nutritional care and
support.
Criteria for Measurement
Example: Criteria for Measurement
1. Meeting all contract deliverable deadlines, prepare guidance
documents, program tools, and written reports on scientific,
policy, and program related issues pertaining to nutrition in
the context of high prevalence of HIV/AIDS. [Demonstrating
: Communication, Job Knowledge, Productivity.]
2. Keep other Center technical staff informed about current
nutrition and HIV/AIDS information and state-of-the-art
practices through briefings, document circulation, and as
needed informal trainings. [Demonstrating: Communication,
Innovation, Staff Development, Team Work.]
TIMING FOR THE COMPLETION OF STEP 2:
By January 31st for existing employees.
Within 30 days from the date of hire for new employees.
Within 30 days after a new job assignment for existing employees receiving an in-grade or grade-to-grade
promotion.
When SECTION I of the EAR is completed, the supervisor keeps the original, and the employee keeps a
copy to guide them through their work for the upcoming year.

MID YEAR ACTIVITY
STEP 3:
Supervisors and employees are required to meet at mid-year, (between June 1 and June 30) to
discuss the employee's performance. The purpose of this meeting is to avoid surprises in
performance dissatisfaction and to reinforce areas where the employee's performance goals are on
track or exceeding expectations. The supervisor and employee write the date of the meeting on
page 1 and both the supervisor and employee initial to indicate that the meeting took place. This is
a mandatory meeting; however, the supervisor is not required to submit a formal, written
review to the HR department.
STEP 4:
Changes in performance objectives may be made at any time during the year, but they must be
recorded in writing on the EAR.
END-OF-YEAR ACTIVITIES
The supervisor completes SECTION II and SECTION III of the EAR.
In SECTION II, the supervisor rates the employee's performance and capabilities in each of the
mandatory competencies and each of the competencies selected as applicable to the employee's
job. Definitions for the ratings are at the beginning of SECTION II. If a particular job competency
is not applicable to the employee's current job, the supervisor selects "Not Applicable".
In SECTION III, the supervisor writes comments explaining how well the employee did, or did not
meet the performance objectives for the year. This section also allows the supervisor to summarize
and explain areas that need improvement.
When the supervisor has completed SECTION II and SECTION III, the supervisor must decide on
an overall rating of the employee's performance for that year. In making this decision, the
supervisor should consider several factors, such as:
1.
The category which reflects the majority of the job competency ratings. For example,
if the employee is rated as "1- Unsatisfactory" in 9 out of the 11 job competencies the
supervisor should consider an overall rating of “1 – Unsatisfactory”. This particular
rating would require the supervisor to work with the Employee Relations Specialist to
develop a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP) for the employee.
2. The written comments in SECTION III about how well the employee met the
performance objectives for the year.
3. Any unusual circumstances, either business or personal, that may have contributed to
the employee's performance. For example, if an employee's performance is
substandard the last two months of the year due to an illness, this should be considered.
Likewise, if an employee has exceeded normal job requirements to assist the center
during a time of high staff turnover, this should be considered as well.
The supervisor completes the box at the top of the EAR signature page, indicating the overall
performance rating for the year.
When completed, the supervisor gives the EAR to the employee and arranges a meeting to discuss
it. At least one hour should be allowed for the EAR discussion, so that the employee has the
opportunity to ask for clarification of the ratings and comments, and the supervisor and employee
can together develop a performance improvement plan for any areas that need improvement.
5
STEP 5:
STEP 6:
STEP 7:
The employee reads the EAR and completes SECTION IV and SECTION V.
The employee and the supervisor meet to discuss SECTION II, SECTION III, SECTION IV, and
SECTION V of the EAR. Both the employee and the supervisor sign the EAR form. Copies of the
completed form are made for the supervisor and the employee.
The supervisor completes the Employee Appraisal Report Approval Sheet (also found on the AED
portal under "AED Forms, Human Resources"). This page is placed at the beginning of the EAR
and is used as a cover sheet. The supervisor signs this page and forwards the entire EAR to the
project/center director for approval. The project/center director reviews the EAR and signs the
Employee Appraisal Report Approval Sheet indicating their approval of the rating and salary
increase recommendation. The project/center director forwards the entire EAR to the group
director who reviews the EAR and signs the Salary Recommendation and Approval Sheet
indicating their approval of the rating and the recommended salary increase. The group director
sends the original EAR form to the Human Resources Office.
NOTE: A supervisor's performance review is considered a formal recommendation for salary
action, but salary decisions are not final until the Officer-in-Charge, the VP of HR, and the
President have reviewed all performance reviews for equity and fairness. Therefore, no salary
recommendation should be discussed with the employee until the approved amount is given
to the supervisor in December.
If the supervisor is recommending a promotion, they must complete and submit a new job
description, along with a copy of the Promotion and Equity Review Request Form to the
Vice President & Director of Human Resources prior to the review conversation. The specific date
these documents are required will be announced each fall.
TIMING FOR THE COMPLETION OF THE ANNUAL REVIEW PROCESS:
Please see the Human Resources page in the AED Portal.
