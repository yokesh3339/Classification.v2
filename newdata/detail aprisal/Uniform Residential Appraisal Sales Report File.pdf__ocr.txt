Uniform Residential Appraisal Report
This report form is designed to report an appraisal of a one-unit property or a one-unit property with an accessory unit;
including a unit in a planned unit development (PUD). This report form is not designed to report an appraisal of a
manufactured home or a unit in a condominium or cooperative project.
This appraisal report is subject to the following scope of work, intended use, intended user, definition of market value,
statement of assumptions and limiting conditions, and certifications. Modifications, additions, or deletions to the intended
use, intended user, definition of market value, or assumptions and limiting conditions are not permitted. The appraiser may
expand the scope of work to include any additional research or analysis necessary based on the complexity of this appraisal
assignment. Modifications or deletions to the certifications are also not permitted. However, additional certifications that do
not constitute material alterations to this appraisal report, such as those required by law or those related to the appraiser's
continuing education or membership in an appraisal organization, are permitted.
File #
SCOPE OF WORK: The scope of work for this appraisal is defined by the complexity of this appraisal assignment and the
reporting requirements of this appraisal report form, including the following definition of market value, statement of
assumptions and limiting conditions, and certifications. The appraiser must, at a minimum: (1) perform a complete visual
inspection of the interior and exterior areas of the subject property, (2) inspect the neighborhood, (3) inspect each of the
comparable sales from at least the street, (4) research, verify, and analyze data from reliable public and/or private sources,
and (5) report his or her analysis, opinions, and conclusions in this appraisal report.
INTENDED USE: The intended use of this appraisal report is for the lender/client to evaluate the property that is the
subject of this appraisal for a mortgage finance transaction.
INTENDED USER: The intended user of this appraisal report is the lender/client.
DEFINITION OF MARKET VALUE: The most probable price which a property should bring in a competitive and open
market under all conditions requisite to a fair sale, the buyer and seller, each acting prudently, knowledgeably and assuming
the price is not affected by undue stimulus. Implicit in this definition is the consummation of a sale as of a specified date and
the passing of title from seller to buyer under conditions whereby: (1) buyer and seller are typically motivated; (2) both
parties are well informed or well advised, and each acting in what he or she considers his or her own best interest; (3) a
reasonable time is allowed for exposure in the open market; (4) payment is made in terms of cash in U. S. dollars or in terms
of financial arrangements comparable thereto; and (5) the price represents the normal consideration for the property sold
unaffected by special or creative financing or sales concessions* granted by anyone associated with the sale.
*Adjustments to the comparables must be made for special or creative financing or sales concessions. No adjustments are
necessary for those costs which are normally paid by sellers as a result of tradition or law in a market area; these costs are
readily identifiable since the seller pays these costs in virtually all sales transactions. Special or creative financing
adjustments can be made to the comparable property by comparisons to financing terms offered by a third party institutional
lender that is not already involved in the property or transaction. Any adjustment should not be calculated on a mechanical
dollar for dollar cost of the financing or concession but the dollar amount of any adjustment should approximate the market's
reaction to the financing or concessions based on the appraiser's judgment.
STATEMENT OF ASSUMPTIONS AND LIMITING CONDITIONS: The appraiser's certification in this report is
subject to the following assumptions and limiting conditions:
1. The appraiser will not be responsible for matters of a legal nature that affect either the property being appraised or the title
to it, except for information that he or she became aware of during the research involved in performing this appraisal. The
appraiser assumes that the title is good and marketable and will not render any opinions about the title.
2. The appraiser has provided a sketch in this appraisal report to show the approximate dimensions of the improvements.
The sketch is included only to assist the reader in visualizing the property and understanding the appraiser's determination
of its size.
3. The appraiser has examined the available flood maps that are provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency
(or other data sources) and has noted in this appraisal report whether any portion of the subject site is located in an
identified Special Flood Hazard Area. Because the appraiser is not a surveyor, he or she makes no guarantees, express or
implied, regarding this determination.
4. The appraiser will not give testimony or appear in court because he or she made an appraisal of the property in question,
unless specific arrangements to do so have been made beforehand, or as otherwise required by law.
5. The appraiser has noted in this appraisal report any adverse conditions (such as needed repairs, deterioration, the
presence of hazardous wastes, toxic substances, etc.) observed during the inspection of the subject property or that he or
she became aware of during the research involved in performing this appraisal. Unless otherwise stated in this appraisal
report, the appraiser has no knowledge of ar hidden or unapparent physical deficiencies or adverse conditions of the
property (such as, but not limited to, needed repairs, deterioration, the presence of hazardous wastes, toxic substances,
adverse environmental conditions, etc.) that would make the property less valuable, and has assumed that there are no such
conditions and makes no guarantees or warranties, express or implied. The appraiser will not be responsible for any such
conditions that do exist or for any engineering or testing that might be required to discover whether such conditions exist.
Because the appraiser is not an expert in the field of environmental hazards, this appraisal report must not be considered as
an environmental assessment of the property.
6. The appraiser has based his or her appraisal report and valuation conclusion for an appraisal that is subject to satisfactory
completion, repairs, or alterations on the assumption that the completion, repairs, or alterations of the subject property will
be performed in a professional manner.

them, unless otherwise indicated in this report.
5. I researched, verified, analyzed, and reported on any current agreement for sale for the subject property, any offering for

6. I researched, verified, analyzed, and reported on the prior sales of the comparable sales for a minimum of one year prior
to the date of sale of the comparable sale, unless otherwise indicated in this report.

reliable sources that I believe to be true and correct.
14. I have taken into consideration the factors that have an impact on value with respect to the subject neighborhood, subject

have noted in this appraisal report any adverse conditions (such as, but not limited to, needed repairs, deterioration, the
presence of hazardous wastes, toxic substances, adverse environmental conditions, etc.) observed during the inspection of the
subject property or that I became aware of during the research involved in performing this appraisal. I have considered these
adverse conditions in my analysis of the property value, and have reported on the effect of the conditions on the value and

15. I have not knowingly withheld any significant information from this appraisal report and, to the best of my knowledge, all
statements and information in this appraisal report are true and correct.
16. I stated in this appraisal report my own personal, unbiased, and professional analysis, opinions, and conclusions, which
are subject only to the assumptions and limiting conditions in this appraisal report.
17. I have no present or prospective interest in the property that is the subject of this report, and I have no present or
prospective personal interest or bias with respect to the participants in the transaction. I did not base, either partially or
completely, my analysis and/or opinion of market value in this appraisal report on the race, color, religion, sex, age, marital
status, handicap, familial status, or national origin of either the prospective owners or occupants of the subject property or of the
present owners or occupants of the properties in the vicinity of the subject property or on any other basis prohibited by law.
18. My employment and/or compensation for performing this appraisal or any future or anticipated appraisals was not
conditioned on any agreement or understanding, written or otherwise, that I would report (or present analysis supporting) a
predetermined specific value, a predetermined minimum value, a range or direction in value, a value that favors the cause of
any party, or the attainment of a specific result or occurrence of a specific subsequent event (such as approval of a pending
mortgage loan application).
19. I personally prepared all conclusions and opinions about the real estate that were set forth in this appraisal report. If I
relied on significant real property appraisal assistance from any individual or individuals in the performance of this appraisal
or the preparation of this appraisal report, I have named such individual(s) and disclosed the specific tasks performed in this
appraisal report. I certify that any individual so named is qualified to perform the tasks. I have not authorized anyone to make
a change to any item in this appraisal report; therefore, any change made to this appraisal is unauthorized and I will take no
responsibility for it.
