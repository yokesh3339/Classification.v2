Individual Condominium Unit Appraisal Report
This report form is designed to report an appraisal of a unit in a condominium project or a condominium unit in a planned
unit development (PUD). This report form is not designed to report an appraisal of a manufactured home or a unit in a
cooperative project.
This appraisal report is subject to the following scope of work, intended use, intended user, definition of market value,
statement of assumptions and limiting conditions, and certifications. Modifications, additions, or deletions to the intended
use, intended user, definition of market value, or assumptions and limiting conditions are not permitted. The appraiser may
expand the scope of work to include any additional research or analysis necessary based on the complexity of this appraisal
assignment. Modifications or deletions to the certifications are also not permitted. However, additional certifications that do
not constitute material alterations to this appraisal report, such as those required by law or those related to the appraiser's
continuing education or membership in an appraisal organization, are permitted.
File #
SCOPE OF WORK: The scope of work for this appraisal is defined by the complexity of this appraisal assignment and the
reporting requirements of this appraisal report form, including the following definition of market value, statement of
assumptions and limiting conditions, and certifications. The appraiser must, at a minimum: (1) perform a complete visual
inspection of the interior and exterior areas of the subject unit, (2) inspect and analyze the condominium project, (3) inspect
the neighborhood, (4) inspect each of the comparable sales from at least the street, (5) research, verify, and analyze data
from reliable public and/or private sources, and (6) report his or her analysis, opinions, and conclusions in this appraisal
report.
INTENDED USE: The intended use of this appraisal report is for the lender/client to evaluate the property that is the
subject of this appraisal for a mortgage finance transaction.
INTENDED USER: The intended user of this appraisal report is the lender/client.
MARKET VALUE: The most probable price which a property should bring in a competitive and open market under all
conditions requisite to a fair sale, the buyer and seller, each acting prudently, knowledgeably and assuming the price is not
affected by undue stimulus. Implicit in this definition is the consummation of a sale as of a specified date and the passing of
title from seller to buyer under conditions whereby: (1) buyer and seller are typically motivated; (2) both parties are well
informed or well advised, and each acting in what he or she considers his or her own best interest; (3) a reasonable time is
allowed for exposure in the open market; (4) payment is made in terms of cash in U. S. dollars or in terms of financial
arrangements comparable thereto; and (5) the price represents the normal consideration for the property sold unaffected by
special or creative financing or sales concessions* granted by anyone associated with the sale.
*Adjustments to the comparables must be made for special or creative financing or sales concessions. No adjustments are
necessary for those costs which are normally paid by sellers as a result of tradition or law in a market area; these costs are
readily identifiable since the seller pays these costs in virtually all sales transactions. Special or creative financing
adjustments can be made to the comparable property by comparisons to financing terms offered by a third party institutional
lender that is not already involved in the property or transaction. Any adjustment should not be calculated on a mechanical
dollar for dollar cost of the financing or concession but the dollar amount of any adjustment should approximate the market's
reaction to the financing or concessions based on the appraiser's judgment.
STATEMENT OF ASSUMPTIONS AND LIMITING CONDITIONS: The appraiser's certification in this report is
subject to the following assumptions and limiting conditions:
1. The appraiser will not be responsible for matters of a legal nature that affect either the property being appraised or the
title to it, except for information that he or she became aware of during the research involved in performing this appraisal.
The appraiser assumes that the title is good and marketable and will not render any opinions about the title.
2. The appraiser has provided a sketch in this appraisal report to show the approximate dimensions of the improvements.
The sketch is included only to assist the reader in visualizing the property and understanding the appraiser's determination
of its size.
3. The appraiser has examined the available flood maps that are provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency
(or other data sources) and has noted in this appraisal report whether any portion of the subject site is located in an
identified Special Flood Hazard Area. Because the appraiser is not a surveyor, he or she makes no guarantees, express or
implied, regarding this determination.
4. The appraiser will not give testimony or appear in court because he or she made an appraisal of the property in question,
unless specific arrangements to do so have been made beforehand, or as otherwise required by law.
5. The appraiser has noted in this appraisal report any adverse conditions (such as needed repairs, deterioration, the
presence of hazardous wastes, toxic substances, etc.) observed during the inspection of the subject property or that he or
she became aware of during the research involved in performing this appraisal. Unless otherwise stated in this appraisal
report, the appraiser has no knowledge of any hidden or unapparent physical deficiencies or adverse conditions of the
property (such as, but not limited to, needed repairs, deterioration, the presence of hazardous wastes, toxic substances,
adverse environmental conditions, etc.) that would make the property less valuable, and has assumed that there are no
such conditions and makes no guarantees or warranties, express or implied. The appraiser will not be responsible for any
such conditions that do exist or for any engineering or testing that might be required to discover whether such conditions
exist. Because the appraiser is not an expert in the field of environmental hazards, this appraisal report must not be
considered as an environmental assessment of the property.
6. The appraiser has based his or her appraisal report and valuation conclusion for an appraisal that is subject to
satisfactory completion, repairs, or alterations on the assumption that the completion, repairs, or alterations of the subject
property will be performed in a professional manner.

have noted in this appraisal report any adverse conditions (such as, but not limited to, needed repairs, deterioration, the
presence of hazardous wastes, toxic substances, adverse environmental conditions, etc.) observed during the inspection of the
subject property or that I became aware of during the research involved in performing this appraisal. I have considered these
adverse conditions in my analysis of the property value, and have reported on the effect of the conditions on the value and

status, handicap, familial status, or national origin of either the prospective owners or occupants of the subject property or of the
present owners or occupants of the properties in the vicinity of the subject property or on any other basis prohibited by law.
18. My employment and/or compensation for performing this appraisal or any future or anticipated appraisals was not
conditioned on any agreement or understanding, written or otherwise, that I would report (or present analysis supporting) a

any party, or the attainment of a specific result or occurrence of a specific subsequent event (such as approval of a pending
mortgage loan application).
19. I personally prepared all conclusions and opinions about the real estate that were set forth in this appraisal report. If I
relied on significant real property appraisal assistance from any individual or individuals in the performance of this appraisal
or the preparation of this appraisal report, I have named such individual(s) and disclosed the specific tasks performed in this
appraisal report. I certify that any individual so named is qualified to perform the tasks. I have not authorized anyone to make
a change to any item in this appraisal report; therefore, any change made to this appraisal is unauthorized and I will take no

Modifications, Additions, or Deletions
This appraisal report is subject to the scope of work, intended use, intended user, definition of market value, statement of assumptions and limiting
conditions, and certifications contained in the report form. Modifications, additions, or deletions to the intended use, intended user, definition of market value,
or assumptions and limiting conditions are not permitted. The appraiser may expand the scope of work to include any additional research or analysis
necessary based on the complexity of this appraisal assignment. Modifications or deletions to the certifications are also not permitted. However, additional
certifications that do not constitute material alterations to this appraisal report, such as those required by law or those related to the appraiser's continuing
education or membership in an appraisal organization are permitted.
Scope of Work
The scope of work for this appraisal is defined by the complexity of this appraisal assignment and the reporting requirements of this appraisal report form,
including the following definition of market value, statement of assumptions and limiting conditions, and certifications. The appraiser must, at a minimum: (1)
perform a complete visual inspection of the interior and exterior areas of the subject unit, (2) inspect and analyze the condominium project, (3) inspect the
neighborhood, (4) inspect each of the comparable sales from at least the street, (5) research, verify, and analyze data from reliable public and/or private
sources, and (6) report his or her analysis, opinions, and conclusions in this appraisal report.
Instructions
New Projects
For units in new (or recently converted) condominium projects, the appraiser must compare the subject property to other properties in its general market
area as well as to properties within the subject project. This comparison should help demonstrate market acceptance of new developments and the
properties within them. Generally, the appraiser should select one comparable sale from the subject project, one comparable sale from outside the subject
project, and one other comparable sale, which can be from inside or outside of the subject project, that the appraiser considers to be a good indicator of
value for the subject property. In selecting the comparables, the appraiser should keep in mind that re-sales from within the subject project are preferable to
sales from outside the project as long as the developer or builder of the subject property is not involved in the transactions.
Established Projects
For units in established condominium projects (those that have resale activity), the appraiser should use comparable sales from within the subject project if
there are any available. Resale activity from within the subject project should be the best indicator of value for properties in that project. If the appraiser uses
sales of comparable properties that are located outside of the subject neighborhood, he or she must include an explanation with the analysis.
Required Exhibits
A street map that shows the location of the subject property and of all comparables that the appraiser used;
●
●
●
●
A sketch of the subject unit that must indicate interior perimeter unit dimensions rather than exterior building dimensions. Generally, the appraiser must
also include calculations to show how he or she arrived at the estimate for gross living area; however, for a unit in a condominium project, the appraiser
may rely on the dimensions and estimate for gross living area that are shown on the plat. In such cases, the appraiser does not need to provide a sketch
of the unit as long as he or she includes a copy of the plat with the appraisal report. A floor plan sketch that indicates the dimensions is required instead
of the exterior building or unit sketch if the floor plan is atypical or functionally obsolete, thus limiting the market appeal for the property in comparison to
competitive properties in the neighborhood;
Clear, descriptive photographs (either in black and white or color) that show the front, back, and a street scene of the subject property, and that are
appropriately identified. (Photographs must be originals that are produced either by photography or electronic imaging.);
Clear, descriptive photographs (either in black and white or color) that show the front of each comparable sale and that are appropriately identified. (We
do not require photographs of comparable rentals and listings.) Generally, photographs should be originals that are produced by photography or
electronic imaging; however, copies of photographs from a multiple listing service or from the appraiser's files are acceptable if they are clear and
descriptive;
Any other data--as an attachment or addendum to the appraisal report form--that are necessary to provide an adequately supported opinion of market
value.
