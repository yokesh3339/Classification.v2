Credit of $150,000 or more, such as a mortgage.
Life insurance with a face value of $150,000 or more.
A job with an annual salary of $75,000 or more.
NOTE: Even if debt does not appear on a credit report, the Consumer
Reporting Agencies (CRA's) keep your older debt on file and can release the
information when you apply for the following:

ADVERSE
ACCOUNTS show lines
of credit that have not
been paid, have missed
or late payments, were
sent to a collection
agency, or were
"charged off" meaning
that the company
reported the debt as
lost income and may
have sold the debt to a
collection agency. A
history of late payments
lowers your credit
score, especially if it's
more recent. Many
lenders will not offer
credit until overdue
debts have been paid.
UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON
TIP: Negative items
can legally be removed
from a credit report if
it's been more than 7
years from the date the
debt first became
overdue. If old items
are listed, contact the
credit bureau and ask
these accounts to be
taken off.
NOTE: Even if debt
does not show up on a
credit report after 7
years, a person may
still owe the debt and
be taken to court,
depending on the State
and type of debt.

The SATISFACTORY
ACCOUNTS section
shows credit
accounts that are
current or have been
paid as agreed. The
accounts listed are
from information
reported by lenders.
Creditors choose
whether to report
account information
to none, one, two, or
all three of the major
Credit Reporting
Agencies and how
often to report.
Having satisfactory
accounts that you pay
the balance on
regularly is good for
your credit score.
The 'Account Type'
lists the kind of credit
account.
TIP: The 'Credit Utilization Ratio” (CUR) is how much of the balance is currently
reported as being used in all your revolving accounts combined.
UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON
• Installment
Accounts like car
or student loans
where you borrow a
set amount and
then make monthly
payments.
• Revolving Accounts
- usually credit
cards that have a
credit limit.
In this sample report, there's only one revolving account. The credit card account
above has a $387 balance divided by $1000 limit = 38% CUR.
To raise your credit score, keep your CUR under 25%. Some credit scoring
models say to keep this ratio under 5% for a better credit score.

the
SATISFACTORY
ACCOUNTS section,
future creditors,
insurance companies,
landlords, and some
employers look for a
history of on-time
payments as a sign
that a person is
responsible and
trustworthy. Positive
information is usually
listed for 10 years after
an account is closed or
paid off. If there is a
history of late
payments, creditors
and insurers may still
work with a person, but
will charge higher
rates.
TIP: Applying for credit could lower your credit score a few points each time
you contact a lender. If you're shopping for the best interest rate on a car
loan, get a few quotes for loans within 14 days of each other. When shopping
for a mortgage, get quotes within 30 days of each other. Most credit scores
will only count these inquiries as one item, instead of many requests.
TIP: Make sure
accounts listed belong
to you and that the
information is correct.
When you order your
report, Credit Reporting
Agencies (CRA's) are
required to provide
information about how
to dispute an item or
correct an error in your
report. Keep a copy of
any letters or emails
you send and customer
service representatives
you speak with. The
CRA usually has 30
days to fix the error or
show why it's correct.

The CREDIT
INQUIRIES section
includes information
about when a credit
report has been
requested. There are
two types of inquiries:
NOTE: You have the right to add a short statement to your credit report to
dispute a credit item or explain a situation. The statement does not affect your
credit score and many lenders may never even read it.
26

REGULAR INQUIRIES
are also known as
HARD inquiries. When
you apply for credit or
buy insurance, for
example, the lender
reviews your credit
report for a positive
history and credit
worthiness. These
inquiries stay on a
report for 2 years and
can be seen by all
creditors who look up
your report. Hard
inquiries can drop a
credit score by 5-20
points for many months.
UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON
ACCOUNT REVIEW
inquiries are also called
SOFT or Promotional
inquiries. Companies
ask for certain parts of
your credit information
to see if you qualify for
their services. These
items are only seen by
you and do not affect
your credit score.
