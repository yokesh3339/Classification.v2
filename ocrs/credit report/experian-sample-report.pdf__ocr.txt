Experian collects and organizes information about you and your credit history from public records, your creditors and other reliable sources. By law, we
cannot disclose certain medical information (relating to physical, mental, or behavioral health or condition). Although we do not generally collect such
information, it could appear in the name of a data furnisher (i.e "Cancer Center") that reports your payment history to us. If so, those names display in
your report, but in reports to others they display only as "Medical Information Provider." Consumer statements included on your report at your request that
contain medical information are disclosed to others.

A Summary of Your Rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act
The federal Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) promotes the accuracy, faimess, and privacy of information in the files of consumer reporting agencies. There
are many types of consumer reporting agencies, including credit bureaus and specialty agencies (such as agencies that sell information about check
writing histories, medical records, and rental history records). Here is a summary of your major rights under the FCRA. For more information, including
information about additional rights, go to www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore or write to: Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, 1700 G
Street N.W., Washington, D.C. 20552.

You must be told if information in your file has been used against you. Anyone who uses a credit report or another type of consumer report to deny
your application for credit, insurance, or employment or to take another adverse action against you must tell you, and must give you the name, address.
and phone number of the agency that provided the information.
You have the right to know what is in your file. You may request and obtain all the information about you in the files of a consumer reporting agency
(your "file disclosure"). You will be required to provide proper identification, which may include your Social Security number. In many cases, the disclosure
will
be free. You are entitled to a free file disclosure if.

to the consumer reporting agency, the agency must investigate unless your dispute is frivolous. See www.consumerfinance.gov/leammore for an
Consumer reporting agencies must correct or delete inaccurate, incomplete, or unverifiable information. Inaccurate, incomplete or unverifiable
information must be removed or corrected, usually within 30 days. However, a consumer reporting agency may continue to report information it has verified
as accurate.
Consumer reporting agencies may not report outdated negative information. In most cases, a consumer reporting agency may not report negative
information that is more than seven years old, or bankruptcies that are more than 10 years old.
Access to your file is limited. A consumer reporting agency may provide information about you only to people with a valid need usually to consider an
application with a creditor, insurer, employer, landlord, or other business.
The FCRA specifies those with a valid need for access.
You must give your consent for reports to be provided to employers. A consumer reporting agency may not give out information about you to your
employer, or a potential employer, without your written consent given to the employer. Written consent generally is not required in the trucking industry. For
more information, go to www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore.
You may limit "prescreened" offers of credit and insurance you get based on information in your credit report. Unsolicited "prescreened" offers for
credit and insurance must include a toll-free phone number you can call if you choose to remove your name and address from the lists these offers are
based on. You may opt-out with the nationwide credit bureaus at 1 888 5OPTOUT (1 888 567 8688).
You may seek damages from violators. If a consumer reporting agency, or, in some cases, a user of consumer reports or a furnisher of information to a
consumer reporting agency violates the FCRA, you may be able to sue in state or federal court.
Identity theft victims and active duty military personnel have additional rights. For more information, visit www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore.
States may enforce the FCRA, and many states have their own consumer reporting laws. In some cases, you may have more rights under state.
law. For more information, contact your state or local consumer protection agency your state Attorney General. For more information about
your federal rights, contact:
