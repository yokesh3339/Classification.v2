TAXES AND ASSESSMENT - The subject property is currently assessed and the following is
the scheduled tax burden for FY 2014:

Taxes
$12,072.16

$12,306.10
However, per the town assessor, a small business deduction allowance reduced the tax
burden in FY 2014 for Parcel 116 to $10,963.80 and the amount for Parcel 115 is $240.96,
bringing the total tax bill to $11,204.76.
Based upon the estimated value of the subject property from this analysis, it is our opinion
that the current assessment is reasonable.
LOCATION DESCRIPTION - Town - The subject property is located in the Middlesex County
community of Westford. Surrounding towns are Littleton and Groton to the west; Tyngsborough
to the north; Chelmsford to the east; Carlisle and Acton to the south. Westford is 23 miles
northwest of Boston and 35 miles northeast of Worcester. Its population per the 2010 US Census
was 21,951, up 5.76% from the 2000 figure.
Once an agricultural and mill community, Westford has rapidly developed over the last 30-
40 years, into a desirable suburban bedroom community. Beginning in the 1970's, with its
location on I-495 and near the Route 3 intersection, Westford began to attract high-tech firms
from the close in suburbs along Route 128. Starting in the 1990's, major companies such as Red
Hat, Verizon, Puma, and Samsung chose Westford to locate major operations. Coupled with a
booming economy the residential growth soared in the 1990's in Westford as well.
With influx in population, there has also been a growth in commercial development,
particularly along the Route 110 corridor, both north and south of the Boston Road intersection.
This section of Westford now contains 4 large retail plazas, numerous national chain restaurants,
regional banks and national pharmacy stores.
8
Residents are attracted to the town because of its convenient location at the intersection of
two of the State's busiest highways, (I-495 and Route 3), an excellent school system, a rural
character, and diverse housing stock.
The character of Westford has been transformed over the past two decades from an
affordable, middle class town, into a relatively affluent, 'white collar' community, home to many
of the areas corporate executives.
Economic & Market Conditions: When completing an appraisal of real property it is necessary
to have a proper perspective of economic conditions as of the date of valuation. Economic
conditions play a significant role in the price paid for real estate at any given time.
As the third quarter of 2014 moves to a close, the economy continues to slowly improve
from the depths of the last recession in 2009. General economic conditions suggest slow
economic growth, moderate job creation, a healthy housing market aided by low mortgage rates, a
fairly strong stock market that is up over 8% for the year in terms of the S&P 500 index, and
consumer confidence levels that suggest the American consumer is gaining confidence in the
country's economic health.
We look at several key economic indicators to measure the health of the economy as of the
date of valuation:

SUBJECT PROPERTY
PERMITTING
AUG 0 5 2014
I have reviewed the information provided by you pertaining to appraisal of the
above referenced property. As a result of this review and an inspection of the property
from the roadway, I am pleased to submit the following proposal for professional
services.
The property which is the subject of this proposal consists of two adjacent tax
parcels totaling approximately 8.97 acres. These parcels are shown as Lot 115 and Lot
116 on Town Assessor's Map 22. Although demised as two tax parcels, they are
essentially a single property.
A majority of the property is undeveloped land with a history (and current) use for
agricultural purposes. The property is also improved with a single story farm stand
operating under several variances from the Town of Westford issued in the 1970's.
The entire property is encumbered by three permanent Agricultural Preservation
Restrictions. The effect of these restrictions is to preclude future development of this
property and limit its use to agricultural.
The purpose of this appraisal is to provide an estimate of the current, as is, market
value of the property subject to all existing restrictions and encumbrances. It is
understood that you will utilize this estimate of market value as the Town responds to a
Right of First Refusal, which has been presented by the property owner in conformance
with the requirements of the Agricultural Preservation Restrictions.

SCOPE OF SERVICES
I propose to prepare an appraisal estimating the current 'as is' market value of the
subject property. This appraisal will be presented in the narrative Appraisal Report
format. The appraisal will be prepared in conformance with the Uniform Standards of
Professional Appraisal Practice and the Code of Professional Ethics of the Appraisal
Institute.
The appraisers at Avery Associates are uniquely experienced and qualified
members of the Appraisal Institute with individually awarded designations of MAI and/or
SRA. All appraisers are certified by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Staff
assignments are made with consideration of applicable experience and availability. All
complex appraisals are prepared with the assistance and review/concurrence of Jonathan
H. Avery, MAI, SRA.
COST/PAYMENT
The fee for the preparation of this appraisal is Three Thousand Nine Hundred
Fifty ($3,950) Dollars. This fee will be due and payable upon delivery of the completed
appraisal report to you in duplicate. I anticipate delivery of this completed appraisal to
you no later than 30 days from the date of receipt of your written acceptance of this
proposal. This fee is for preparation and delivery of the appraisal. Post appraisal
services, including but not limited to, preparation for or appearance at formal or informal
hearings proceedings or trials, will incur additional charges at a rate of $300 per hour.
This proposal is valid for a period of 10 days from the date hereof and may be
withdrawn at any time prior to your acceptance. If you have any questions regarding this
proposal, please feel free to contact me.
If this proposal meets with your approval, please so indicate below and return
your acceptance to me.

APPRAISAL LEXICON
&
ASSUMPTIONS, LIMITING CONDITIONS
MARKET VALUE
"The most probable price, which a property should bring in a competitive and open
market under all conditions requisite to a fair sale, the buyer and seller each acting prudently,
knowledgeably and assuming the price is not affect by undue stimulus. Implicit in this definition
is consummation of a sale as of a specified date and passing of title from seller to buyer under
conditions whereby:
1. Buyer and seller are motivated;
2. Both parties are well informed or well advised and each acting in what he
considers his own best interest;
3. A reasonable time is allowed for exposure in the open market;
4. Payment is made in terms of cash in U.S. dollars, or in terms of financial arrangements
comparable thereto; and
APPRAISAL LEXICON
5. The price represents the normal consideration for the property sold unaffected
by special or creative financing, or sales concessions granted by anyone
associated with the sale." (1)
FEE SIMPLE ESTATE
Absolute ownership unencumbered by any other interest or estate, subject only to the
limitations imposed by the governmental powers of taxation, eminent domain, police power and
escheat. (2)
HIGHEST AND BEST USE
The reasonably probable and legal use of vacant land or an improved property, that is
physically possible, appropriately supported, financially feasible, and that results in the highest
value. The four criteria the highest and best use must meet are legal permissibility, physical
possibility, financial feasibility and maximum productivity. Alternatively, the probable use of
land or improved property - specific with respect to the user and timing of the use that is
adequately supported and results in the highest present value. (3)
LEASED FEE INTEREST
A freehold (ownership interest) where the possessory interest has been granted to another
party by creation of a contractual landlord-tenant relationship (i.e., a lease). (4)
MARKETING TIME
An opinion of the amount of time it might take to sell a real or personal property interest
at the concluded market value level during the period immediately after the effective date of an
appraisal. Marketing time differs from exposure time, which is always presumed to precede the
effective date of an appraisal. (5)

(3) Ibid. - 93.
(4) Ibid. - 111.
(5) Ibid. - 121.
MARKET RENT
The most probable rent that a property should bring in a competitive and open market
reflecting all conditions and restrictions of the lease agreement, including permitted uses, use
restrictions, expense obligations, term, concessions, renewal and purchase options, and tenant
improvements (TIS). (6)
EXPOSURE TIME
1. The time a property remains on the market.
2. The estimated length of time the property interest being appraised would have been
offered on the market prior to the hypothetical consummation of a sale at market value on
the effective date of the appraisal; a retrospective estimate based on an analysis of past
events assuming a competitive and open market. (7)
PROSPECTIVE OPINION OF VALUE
A value opinion effective as of a specified future date. The term does not define a type of
value. Instead, it identifies a value opinion as being effective at some specific future date. An
opinion of value as of a prospective date is frequently sought in connection with projects that are
proposed, under construction, or under conversion to a new use, or those that have not yet
achieved sellout or a stabilized level of long-term occupancy. (8)
RETROSPECTIVE OPINION OF VALUE
A value opinion effective as of a specified historical date. The term does not define a
type of value. Instead, it identifies a value opinion as being effective at some specific prior date.
Value as of a historical date is frequently sought in connection with property tax appeals, damage
models, lease renegotiation, deficiency judgments, estate tax, and condemnation. Inclusion of
the type of value with this term is appropriate, e.g., "retrospective market value opinion." (9)

3.
The information furnished by others is believed to be reliable. However, no warranty is given for its

5. It is assumed that there are no hidden or unapparent conditions of the property, subsoil, or structures
that render it more or less valuable. No responsibility is assumed for such conditions or for arranging
for engineering studies that may be required to discover them.
6.
It is assumed that there is full compliance with all applicable federal, state, and local environmental
regulations and laws unless noncompliance is stated, defined, and considered in the appraisal report.
7.
It is assumed that all applicable zoning and use regulations and restrictions have been complied with,

9.
It is assumed that the utilization of the land and improvements is within the boundaries or property
lines of the property described and that there is no encroachment or trespass unless noted in the report.
This appraisal report has been made with the following general limiting conditions:

identity of the appraiser, or the firm with which the appraiser is connected) shall be disseminated to the
public through advertising, public relations, news, sales, or other media without the prior written
consent and approval of the appraiser.
5. Any value estimates provided in the report apply to the entire property, and any proration or division of
the total into fractional interests will invalidate the value estimate, unless such proration or division of
interests has been set forth in the report.
6.
The forecasts, projections, or operating estimates contained herein are based upon current market
conditions, anticipated short-term supply and demand factors, and a continued stable economy. These
forecasts are, therefore, subject to changes in future conditions.

In terms of the GDP, the most recent figures released for the U.S. economy show an
annualized growth rate in the 2nd quarter of 2014 of 4.2%, a solid rebound from the 1st quarter
figure of negative 2.1%. The negative figure in the first quarter was attributed the terrible weather
experienced nationwide this past winter. The rebound in the 2nd quarter has been attributed to the
pent up demand being satisfied from Q1. Annualized growth rates of 3.5%+ are needed to
provide a substantial boost to the economy that would result in significant job growth and the past
quarter is a solid start. In Massachusetts economic growth has been better, with a 4.9%
annualized growth rate for the 2nd quarter of 2014 following a slight decline of 0.3% in Q1.
As with the GDP figures, the employment figures are showing moderate growth,
although last month took a step backwards. The last 12 months have included 9 months in which
new jobs created were north of the 200,000 mark. However, typically, post-recession job growth
exceeding 300,000 per month is common. The average over the past 12 months is 214,750 per
month. Most economists indicate that job growth in the vicinity of 150,000 per month is needed
just to keep up with population growth. So while employment gains are positive, the gains have
not been enough to substantially boost the economy. After the 1981-82 recession, for example,
the economy added more jobs in the next two years that at any time in the modern era. Monthly
job growth topped 400,000 four times during that recovery. And this was at a time when the
overall population in the country was 230+/- million versus the current 320+/- million.
The stock market in 2013 posted some of the biggest gains in history. The S&P 500
increased nearly 30%. This was after a 2012 that saw gains exceeding 13%. Indeed the stock
market, aided by low interest rates and the Federal Reserves bond buyback program has been a
strong positive to the economy. 2014 got off to a slower start, but is now up 8.3% for the year
according to the S&P 500 Index.
The consumer confidence data shown above portrays the ups and downs of the economy
over the past 6+ years. The index data is shown for August of each of the past 8 years. The most
recent figure of 92.4 is the 4th straight monthly increase after a decrease in April. Per the
Conference Board a reading above 90 translates into an economy on solid footing while a reading
above 100 reflects strong economic growth. So with a current reading at 92.4 the U.S. Consumer
is beginning to feel more positive about economic conditions. The 92.4 reading is the highest
seen since early 2008.
The housing market in Massachusetts has stabilized from the severe downturn that took
place between the 3rd quarter of 2005 and the end of 2008 and for the past two years has shown
signs of surging back to the levels of the peak market of 2003-2005. During the 2005-2008
period, by several measures, prices dropped approximately 15-25% in Greater Boston. Since the
2nd quarter of 2009 the market has stabilized, but is not yet back to the price level, or sales volume
that was seen in 2004 and 2005. An index considered reliable by most is the Case-Shiller Home
Price Index. This data includes only repeat sales of homes. The most recent data from the Case-
Shiller Home Price Index listed on the previous page indicates that we are up 7% in terms of
pricing from one year ago, and up 20.28% since the low reached in March of 2009. However, the
market is still below the levels reach in September of 2005. Per this index, home prices in the
Boston metropolitan area are still down 3.38% from the peak reached in September of 2005.
11
Based upon a review of this index as well as a review of sales activity, we have used a
+6% annualized time adjustment applied to the comparable sales used later in this report.
Agricultural Land Market Trends The demand for organic and locally grown food has
greatly aided the local farmer over the past 5-7 years. The effect on the market for agricultural
land in the region has been an increase in demand and rising prices.
Unlike the residential and commercial property markets, there are no price indices that
track the value of agricultural land. But in talking with area brokers, farmers, and observing
trends, it is evident that prices for farmland in the area have been on the increase during the past 5
years. Consider the sale/re-sale of Lot 5 Haynes Road in Sudbury, presented later in this report.
Purchased in April of 2006 for a total of $450,000, it sold 88 months later in July of 2013 for
$1,000,000, which translates into an annual appreciation rate of over 13%. Some of this increase
was due to improvements in the structures on site and irrigation. But the majority of the increase
can be attributed to positive conditions for agricultural land in the region.
CONCLUSIONS: We draw the following conclusions from a review of the data presented above
and a review of market activity:
As of the date of valuation, the economy is stable and growing, albeit at a tepid pace. Job
growth has been steady and consumer confidence is growing.
The market for agricultural land has been, and continues to be positive. While the prime
market for agricultural land in Massachusetts is the Connecticut River valley in Western
Massachusetts, there remains good demand for agricultural land in the Middlesex County area
as well.
Barring a major economic downturn, market conditions are expected to be strong through
2014 and 2015 in the subject market and Massachusetts.
Each of these factors has been taken into consideration with the valuation of the subject
property.
Neighborhood - The subject property is located on the northwest side of Boston Road in the
southern portion of Westford. Access to I-495 is 0.25 miles to the east. Westford Center is 0.9
miles to the northwest. The Route 110/Boston Road intersection, the main commercial corridor in
Westford, is 0.5 miles to the southeast.
MassHighway last estimated the daily traffic count in front of the subject at 17,000
vehicles per day in 2006. With the development that has occurred in the immediate area since,
that figure is likely to have risen substantially since.
The immediate area around the subject, from I-495 to the southeast, to Westford Center to
the northwest, is generally residential and open space in nature. Across Boston Road from the
subject is the 35 home Blakes Hill development which features 3,500+/- sq ft homes constructed
in the 1990s that are now selling in the $780,000 to $900,000 range. Just east of Blakes Hill is a
newer development; the 20 unit Cottages in the Woods affordable housing complex that features
all affordable units and is a joint venture between the Town of Westford and private developers.
12
Further west off of Boston Road are two larger single family neighborhoods constructed in
the 1960's and 1980's. Abutting the subject to the east is a local real estate office. This property
features a converted antique farmhouse and barn into offices. Abutting the subject to the north are
wetlands conservation tracts. Abutting to the west is the 1960's era Kings Pine neighborhood
featuring modest ranch style homes selling in the $400,000 price range.
Heading east along Boston Road from the subject one enters the busy and continually
growing commercial district at the intersection with Littleton Road. This district features 4 large
shopping centers, including the recently completed 225,000 sq ft Cornerstone Square, several
national chain restaurants, three extended stay hotels, two national pharmacy chains and two
major office parks on the north and south perimeter of the district.
The location of the subject property is a strong positive factor affecting its value as a
commercial farmstand and agricultural property. It is located on a busy roadway near a major
highway and commercial district, but is distant enough to be within an area of open space and
residential neighborhoods.
PROPERTY DESCRIPTION: The subject of this report is 8.97 acres of land located on the
northwest side of Boston Road in Westford just west of I-495, improved with a farmstand/country
store and greenhouses. The land is zoned Residence A and is affected by 3 agricultural
preservation restrictions (APR) placed on the property in 1998-99.

Based upon the recorded APR plan, a copy of which can be found in the
Addenda to this report, there are approximately 1.5 acres of wetlands on
site located to the rear, or NW portion of the land.
The site has access to municipal water, electricity, natural gas and
all telecommunication lines. There is no municipal sewer available to the
subject land. The existing buildings utilize a small on site private septic
system.
Per the maps of the USDA/NRCS the predominant soil type found
on site is Woodbridge fine sandy loam with 3-8% slopes. Woodbridge soils
have friable fine sandy loam or sandy loam surface soil and subsoil with
moderate permeability over a firm, fine sandy loamor sandy loam
substratum. This soil typically has a seasonal high water table at 18-24
inches.
None observed or referenced within the deed to the subject property.
There are 3 APR's that affect 100% of the land, recorded in 1998-99. The
details of the APR's can be found in the ID section of this report.
Improvements
There is a single story, wood frame farmstand/country store building on site in
southeastern portion of the land, or the ‘right side' if viewing the plans. The building is located
within the APR 3 portion of the land.
The building is of wood frame construction and was constructed in 1972 per municipal
records. There is 5,176 square feet of finished area, plus a 7' x 45' front open porch. The
building is built upon a concrete slab. It is heated by a forced hot air by gas system.
Exterior walls are cedar clapboard. Roof is asphalt shingle. The interior has a 'rustic' feel
with exposed wood truss ceilings and unfinished flooring. There is a ½ bath within the interior.
Attached to the main building is a 21' x 18' greenhouse with aluminum framing.
To the rear of the main building are ‘hoop' greenhouses of lower quality.
14
The main building on site is in average overall condition. It is a ‘rustic', minimalist
building that is actually a large wood frame shed built on slab that is heated. There is no interior
wall or ceiling finishes and only a part of the main building is insulated.
The greenhouse structures on site are in just fair overall condition.
Consideration of Hazardous Substances in the Appraisal Process
Although no specific geotechnical engineering data has been provided, it is our assumption
that the property is free and clear of any hazardous wastes or contaminating substances, as
specified in applicable municipal, state and federal regulations or laws. In the event that this is
not the case, the value as estimated herein may vary to the extent of contamination and the cost of
cleanup.
As of September 17, 2014 the subject property is not included as either a contaminated site
or a location to be investigated by the Bureau of Waste Site Cleanup of the Department of
Environmental Protection, Commonwealth of Massachusetts. It is our assumption in this report,
therefore, that the subject site is not a contaminated site. However, if the subject site is found to
be contaminated, the value estimate contained herein will change.
Zoning
The subject land is located within the Residence A zoning district. Permitted uses in this
zone include single-family dwellings, religious; municipal; governmental uses, and agricultural
uses. Per the bylaw an adjunct to the agriculture use includes a "facility for the sale of produce
and wine and dairy products, provided that during the months of June, July, August and
September of every year, or during the harvest season of the primary crop, the majority of such
products for sale, based on either gross sales dollars or volume, have been produced by the
owner of the land containing more than five acres in area on which the facility is located”.
Dimensional requirements call for a minimum lot size of 40,000 square feet, a minimum
frontage of 200', and front, side, and rear setbacks of 50', 15', and 30' respectively. The
maximum building height is 35'.
Reduced frontage lots of no less than 50 feet are allowed. However, with a reduced
frontage lot, the minimum lot size is increased to 120,000 sq ft.
The minimum parking requirement is two spaces per dwelling unit.
The current use of the subject property as a country store/farm stand on the eastern portion
of the site is allowed via local zoning. In addition the retail farm or 'roadside stand' operation of
the subject is allowed via Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 40A section 3. This law clearly
states "no zoning ordinance or by law shall regulate or restrict - nor shall any such ordinance or
by law prohibit, unreasonably regulate or require a special permit for the use of land for the
primary purpose of agriculture, or require a special permit for the use, expansion, or
reconstruction of existing agriculture, including those facilities for the sale of produce”.
Massachusetts General Laws most definitely favor agricultural uses in all zoning districts even if
these uses involve a commercial operation.
15
Also, the property is subject to a Zoning Board of Appeals decisions dated June 2, 1978
and August 19, 1974. In general terms, a Variance was granted in 1974 to allow for the existing
building and 500 SF expansion to be used as a "Country Store". In 1978 the Board of Appeals
granted a second Variance to allow for a 40'x'40' addition to the Drew Farms Country Store. The
1978 decision also allowed for the sale of certain products not grown on the premises. However,
it was an express condition of the Variance that no prepared foods were to be eaten on the
premises.
Board of Health Septic System Regulations
New and existing septic systems in town must conform to Title 5 of the State
Environmental Code, 310 CMR 15.000. And although municipal sewer lines exist on Main
Street, all new lots created after 2004 must use private septic systems for the treatment of effluent
as there is a moratorium on sewer connections in town.
HIGHEST AND BEST USE
The Dictionary of Real Estate Appraisal, Fifth Edition defines highest and best use as "the
reasonably probable and legal use of vacant land or an improved property, which is physically
possible, appropriately supported, financially feasible and results in the highest value. The four
criteria the highest and best use must meet are legal permissibility, physical possibility, financial
feasibility and maximum profitability."
The uses of the subject property are limited, not only by existing zoning in the RA district,
but also by the three APR's that affect the 8.97 acre property. For the APR1 and APR2 portions
of the subject, which, if facing the property is the left 2/3, these 6.12 acres are limited to
agricultural and open space use. Temporary agricultural structures may be allowed on this land.
For the APR3 portion of the subject, which is the far right 1/3 of the property if facing it
from Boston Road, the existing and continued use of these 2.85 acres as a farmstand/country store
operation is allowed both by zoning and the APR document. Permanent structures are allowed on
this portion of the site provided they are used for agricultural purposes which do include the retail
sale of agriculturally related products.
16
It should also be noted that with APR's 1 & 2, the definition of 'actively engaged'
agricultural uses states that 51% of annual income from agricultural uses must come from product
grown on site. However, with APR 3, 'actively engaged' means “deriving substantial annual
farm income from agricultural uses of all available areas on site and the two contiguous parcels".
Therefore, there is no set percentage of product that must be produced on site in order for it to be
sold within the store. This allows for a broad interpretation of what agricultural products may be
sold within the store.
Based upon this analysis, and the location of the subject, it is our opinion that the highest
and best use of the subject property is for its continued use as a farmstand/country store in
accordance with existing zoning and the 3 APR's that affect the property.
EXPOSURE TIME
The Dictionary of Real Estate, 5th Edition, defines Exposure Time as:
"The estimated length of time the property interest being appraised would have been offered on the
market prior to the hypothetical consummation of a sale at market value on the effective date of
appraisal. Exposure time is always presumed to occur prior to the effective date of appraisal" (p
105)
In other words, how long do we estimate it would have taken to sell the subject property at
the estimated "as is" value of $725,000? Based upon a review of the periods it took to sell the
comparable sales presented later in this report, it is our opinion that a reasonable exposure time is
9-12 months.
17
In order to estimate the value of the subject property we have utilized a Sale Comparison Approach. However, given the data that was available and our opinion of the highest and best use of the property, this approach will be broken into two sections; first, a valuation of the vacant 6.12 acres of restricted APR land on the property, shown as APR1 and APR2 on the recorded plan of land; followed by a valuation of the APR3 portion of the subject, which is an improved farmstand/country store parcel.
Ideally, we would have found sales of properties of 8-9 acres on which a farmstand building existed and the APR restrictions differed, depending upon what portion of the site was being analyzed, but those sales simply did not exist. The subject is rather unique. While it is 100% affected by agricultural preservation restrictions, there are 3 different ones that affect the subject and the degree of restrictions differ. This method of valuation, in our opinion, best reflects how the typical buyer and seller would view the property.
Restricted Land (APR1, APR 2) Valuation: We searched for recent sales of smaller tracts of land that sold restricted, either legally or physically to agricultural, or open space use. Due to the lack of more recent data in the immediate area, we extended the search period and area beyond the immediate Westford area.
This search produced 5 sales considered most similar to the 6.12 acres of the subject property shown as APR1 and APR2 on the recorded plan of land.
The following is a summary of these sales:

COMMENTS - REASON(S) FOR NON-BUILDABLE STATUS
Sale of agriculatural-pasture land on Indian Hill in Groton. The land is
prevented from development per a deed restriction. The 1.71 acres includes
a 3 story barn. Located among several horse properties and was purchased
by neighbor for personal use.
Land sold subject to an agricultural preservation restriction (APR). It cannot
be developed and has been used in the past both for cropland and pasture
for horses and sheep. Purchased by neighbors who own a single family
home 1/4 mile north and who plan to continue farming the land. Grantor in this
transaction purchased the land in April 2006 for $495,000.
Sale of 4.56 acres off of Western Ave in Sherborn. Marketed, and purchased
with knowledge that the land could not ever be developed because of soil
conditions. Sold and priced as such. Post sale, the buyer built a large, 156' x
70' horse riding arena and uses the land for pasture and maintaining horses.
Sale of 8 acres of restricted farmland next to Applefield Farms on Great Rd
in Stow. This land is restricted to agricultural uses only - no development, via
an APR recorded in Book 51386 Page 88 in June of 2008. The land is used for
growing corn, beans, pumpkins, squash and lettuce. Merrimac soils.
Mostly cleared tract of farmland which straddles the Northborough-Boylston
town line previously utilized by grantee for growing a variety of field crops. Land
is subject to an APR. Cannot be developed.
Sales Analysis
The sales have been compared to the subject on a price per acre basis. This is an all
inclusive indicator that takes into consideration the locational and physical characteristics of each
property. The subject's acreage for this component is 6.12. The unadjusted prices per acre range
from $3,296 to $43,735. We have used a +6% annualized adjustment to account for the general
appreciation in prices that has occurred for agricultural properties in the area over the past 5-7
years.
The time adjusted prices range from $3,722 to $50,228 per acre.
A significant factor that affects the price per acre of these sale properties is the size of the
acreage itself. Smaller parcels most often sell for more on a per acre basis than larger parcels if all
other factors are held equal. Sale #1 from above is a good example of this. While generally
inferior to #2 in terms of location and utility, it sold for more on a per acre basis. The reason is its
small size.
The subject 6.12 acres is generally superior to #1 in terms of location. But again, the size
issue must be considered here. The subject is inferior to #2 in terms of location and utility, but is
much smaller at 6.12 acres versus 26.17 acres.
Sale #3 is generally similar, overall to the subject's acreage both in terms of size and
location. We give a slight edge in location to the subject as it lends itself to a retail-agricultural
use best of any of the comparable sales.
Based upon this analysis, it is our opinion that an appropriate indicator for the 6.12 acre
portion of the subject property known as APR1 and APR2, is $25,000 per acre.
Farmstand (APR3) Valuation – For this portion of the subject property we have 2.85 acres on
which a farmstand/country store is allowed. This portion of the subject can have permanent
structures on site that can be maintained, remodeled and expanded if desired, so long as the
expansion/new construction conforms to zoning and building code regulations and is used for sale
of agricultural items. A septic system is allowed to be maintained and installed on this portion in
conjunction with farmstand operation. The allowances under APR3 are starkly different than
those for APR1 & 2. It is for this reason that the valuation portion of this appraisal needed to
have two components.
To value this portion of the property, we searched for sales for which a farmstand/country
store was the highest and best use of the property at the time of sale, similar to our opinion of the
highest and best use of the APR3 portion of the subject property.
Of 7-9 sale initially researched, the following were considered most similar to the APR3
portion of the subject property:

Sale of a farmstand property on Route 119 in Groton near the Pepperell line.
Sale included a 2.42 acre site plus a single story, 1,587 sq ft farmstand building.
Zoned Residence A. 20 Parking spaces on site. Public water, private septic. Store
now sales flowers, pumpkins, apples and products grown at nearby fields.
Sale of a farmstand property on busy Main Street in Rockport. This property once
included a dwelling with attached farmstand on a 1 acre site. The sellers decided
they wanted to retain dwelling, but sell off farmstand. They sudbdivided property
and sold. Residential zone. In addition to farmstand building, there are two 'hoop'
greenhouses on site.
Sale of a farmstand/florist shop on Route 113 in Dunstable. Residential zone.
Operates under an agricultural exemption that allows for sales of ag products.
Former Rose of Sharon property. Site contains two buildings with a total area
of 2,895 sq ft.
Sale of the Deershorn Farms farmstand on Route 62. Located in a Res/Ag zone.
Retail use is allowed under this zoning as much of the product sold has been
grown on the 5.01 acres.
Sale of Former Pennsylvania Farm Boy vegetable stand in Bellingham. Located in
residential zone. Sale includes the farmstand building plus an older dwelling that is
used for offices. On market at $399,900 for 225 days prior to sale at $342,000.
Sales Analysis
These sales have been compared to the subject on both a price per acre basis and a price
per sq ft of the main building area basis. However, the price per acre is the primary unit of
comparison for this analysis. Typically the buildings associated with a farmstand are lesser
quality wood frame structures, similar to the subject. The typical buyer of a farmstand property is
focused on the acreage, the ability to park cars and the ability to place a seasonal retail structure
on site.
The unadjusted prices per acre range from $74,850 to $480,509. We have used a +6%
annualized adjustment to account for the general appreciation in prices that has occurred for
agricultural properties in the area over the past 5-7 years.
The time adjusted prices range from $93,692 to $496,468 per acre. This is a wide spread,
but not unexpected given the rarity of the sales for this property type.
For all 5 sales, the highest and best use at the time of sale was for continued farmstand use.
Although Sales #3, #4, and #5 could have possibly been used for residential purposes, they were
purchased for continued farmstand use as it was their highest and best use.
Sale #1 is similar to the APR3 portion of the subject property in terms of size and utility,
but is inferior to the subject in terms of location and the buildings on site. Sale #1 is located in a
far less busy area than the subject and the building on site only lent itself to season use and was
significantly smaller than the subject. This analysis suggests the indicator for the subject must be
moderately higher than the $131,827 for this sale.
Sale #2 is similar to the subject in terms of location. But it is significantly smaller. As
with the vacant land sales, the price/size ratio is a consideration here. If this property were 3+/-
acre instead of .67 acres, we are confident it would have sold for much less on a per acre basis.
Sale #3 is located in nearby Dunstable. It is inferior to the subject in terms of location.
But its structures on site at the time of sale are superior to the subject.
Sale #4 is an older sale of a farmstand in Lancaster. It is inferior to the subject in terms of
location and site improvements.
Sale #5 is slightly superior to the subject, overall in terms of site improvements, and is
similar overall in terms of location.
Based upon this analysis, it is our opinion that an appropriate indicator for the 2.85 acre
portion of the subject property known as APR3 is $200,000 per acre.
22
VALUATION SUMMARY
We have individual values of the 2 components that comprise the subject property; the
6.12- acres of APR1 & 2 and the 2.85 acres of APR3-the farmstand/country store portion. As
both components are small, and could be sold in relatively short time (under 1 year), it is our
opinion that discounting of the individual components to a present value is not appropriate here.
Rather, in this unique case, adding the two components together is reflective of its market value.
Completing this valuation results in a market value estimate of the entire property to a
single buyer of $725,000 as of September 17, 2014 calculated as follows:

RECONCILIATION AND VALUE CONCLUSION
The final step in estimating the market value of the subject property is a correlation of the
value from each of the approaches utilized in the appraisal process. In order to estimate the value
of the fee simple interest in the property we utilized a Sales Comparison Approach involving two
different property types that are similar to what we have with the subject property.
5 sales of agricultural/open space land in the Middlesex and Worcester County areas; and
5 sales of farmstand properties were reviewed and analyzed in order to make price projections for
the 2 components of the subject property. We then added the individual values of these two
components in order to derive a value estimate for the entire 8.97 acre property of $725,000.
Based upon the methods of valuation utilized, it is our opinion that the market value of the
fee simple interest in the subject property, as of September 17, 2014, is:
SEVEN HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND ($725,000) DOLLARS

MAP INFORMATION
The soil surveys that comprise your AOI were mapped at 1:25,000.
Warning: Soil Map may not be valid at this scale.
Enlargement of maps beyond the scale of mapping can cause
misunderstanding of the detail of mapping and accuracy of soil line
placement. The maps do not show the small areas of contrasting
soils that could have been shown at a more detailed scale.
Please rely on the bar scale on each map sheet for map
measurements.
Source of Map: Natural Resources Conservation Service
Web Soil Survey URL: http://websoilsurvey.nrcs.usda.gov
Coordinate System: Web Mercator (EPSG:3857)
Maps from the Web Soil Survey are based on the Web Mercator
projection, which preserves direction and shape but distorts
distance and area. A projection that preserves area, such as the
Albers equal-area conic projection, should be used if more accurate
calculations of distance or area are required.
This product is generated from the USDA-NRCS certified data as of
the version date(s) listed below,
Soil Survey Area:
Survey Area Data:
Middlesex County, Massachusetts
Version 13, Dec 17, 2013
Soil map units are labeled (as space allows) for map scales 1:50,000
or larger.
Date(s) aerial images were photographed: Mar 30, 2011-May 1,
2011
The orthophoto or other base map on which the soil lines were
compiled and digitized probably differs from the background
imagery displayed on these maps. As a result, some minor shifting
of map unit boundaries may be evident.
