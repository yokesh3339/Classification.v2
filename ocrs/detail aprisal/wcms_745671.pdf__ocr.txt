End of cycle comments and ratings: Direct Supervisor Official Mr X has shown a great deal of initiative, leadership and flexibility. Staffing changes part way through the period led to an unexpected increase in workload for the team, and Mr X worked closely with them to define priorities and provide motivation through what was a very difficult period. The new recruit is settling in well, and Mr X is always on hand to share knowledge and give guidance to all team members. His motivational skills are reflected in the very positive upward feedback given to him by his team in the recent report. When a new team member was recruited I spent a lot of time giving support and feedback, and helping the new recruit integrate with the rest of the team.

End of cycle comments and ratings: Direct Supervisor Official Mr X has worked toward completing the agreed measures with efficiency and professionalism. Despite his efforts to ensure timely forecast submission, a last-minute change in circumstances, beyond the official’s control, caused a small delay to one submission. One forecast was slightly delayed due to a sudden increase in the exchange rate. The rest were submitted within the prescribed deadlines.

End of cycle comments and ratings: Direct Supervisor Official Mr X was consistently proactive and timely in the execution of his duties. I was particularly impressed with the office supplies inventory system he developed in collaboration with the Purchase Committee, which has simplified the purchase of our office supplies. His work contributed to the efficient operation of the office. Although there were sometimes conflicting priorities (e.g. when the email failed and a revised project forecast had to be urgently submitted) I always tried to ensure that the office was operational.
