2. COLLATERAL DESCRIPTION: Preparer should coordinate with user to ensure the collateral is sufficiently identified. Suggested forms of collateral identification include, but are not limited to, property address, parcel or lot number and longitude/latitude. If needed, additional information may be attached to this form.
3. LENDER/SERVICER ID NO: Optional. Preparer should coordinate with user to ensure the lender is sufficiently identified on the form. The lender name and address (Box 1. above) may be sufficient.

A lender retains the prerogative to require flood insurance in excess of the minimum federal requirements not by the direction of FEMA. National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) policies do not provide coverage in excess of the insured value of the building/mobile home/personal property.
SECTION 2 A. NATIONAL FLOOD INSURANCE PROGRAM (NFIP) COMMUNITY JURISDICTION 1. NFIP Community Name. Enter the complete name of the community (as indicated on the NFIP map) in which the building or mobile home is located. Under the NFIP, a community is the political unit that has authority to adopt and enforce floodplain management regulations for the areas within its jurisdiction. A community may be any State or area or political subdivision thereof, or any Indian tribe or authorized tribal organization, or Alaska Native village or authorized native organization. (Examples: Brewer, City of; Washington, Borough of; Worchester, Township of; Baldwin County; Jefferson Parish) For a building or mobile home that may have been annexed by one community but is shown on another community's NFIP map, enter the Community Name for the community with land-use jurisdiction over the building or mobile home.
2. County(ies). Enter the name of the county or counties in which the community is located. For unincorporated areas of a county, enter "unincorporated areas." For independent cities, enter "independent city."
3. State. Enter the two-digit state abbreviation. (Examples: VA, TX, CA)
4. NFIP Community Number. Enter the 6-digit NFIP community number. This number can be determined by consulting the NFIP Community Status Book or can be found on the NFIP map; copies of either can be obtained from FEMA's Website http://msc/fema.gov or by calling 1-800-358-9616. If no NFIP Community Number exists for the community, enter "none."
B. NFIP DATA AFFECTING BUILDING/MOBILE HOME The information in this section (excluding the LOMA/LOMR information) is obtained by reviewing the NFIP map on which the building/mobile home is located. The current NFIP map may be obtained from FEMA by calling 1-800-358-9616. Scanned copies of the NFIP maps can be viewed on FEMA's website at http://msc.fema.gov. Note that even when an NFIP map panel is not printed, it may be reflected on a community's NFIP map index with its proper number, date, and flood zone indicated; enter these data accordingly.
1. NFIP Map Number or Community-Panel Number. Enter the 11-digit number shown on the NFIP map that covers the building or mobile home. (Examples: 480214 0022C; 58103C0075F). Some older maps will have a 9-digit number (Example: 12345601A). Note that the first six digits will not match the NFIP Community Number when the sixth digit is a "C" or when one community has annexed land from another but the NFIP map has not yet been updated to reflect this annexation. When the sixth digit is a "C", the NFIP map is in countywide format and shows the flood hazards for the geographic areas of the county on one map, including flood hazards for incorporated communities and for any unincorporated county contained within the county's geographic limits. Such countywide maps will list an NFIP Map Number. For maps not in such countywide format, the NFIP will list a Community-Panel Number on each panel. If no NFIP map is in effect for the location of the building or mobile home, enter "none."

This field can remain blank if no Letter of Map Change (LOMC) (these include the Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA), Letter of Map Revision (LOMR) or similar FEMA Map Letter(s)) applies to the subject property. If there is a LOMC, list the date and number. Information on the LOMC is available from the following sources: * The community's official copy of its NFIP map(s) should have a copy of all subsequently-issued FEMA Letters attached. * For a LOMC issued on or after October 1, 1994. Information is available on FEMA's website at http://www.fema.gov/national-flood-insurance- program-flood-hazard-mapping/compendium-flood-map-changes. * The FEMA Map Service Center website is https://msc.fema.gov/portal.

If any part of the building or mobile home is within the Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA), the entire building or mobile home is considered to be in the SFHA. All flood zones beginning with the letter "A" or "V" are considered to be in the SFHA. Each flood zone is defined in the legend of the NFIP map on which it appears. If there is no NFIP map for the subject area, enter "none."
5. No NFIP Map. If no NFIP map covers the area where the building or mobile home is located, check this box.
C. FEDERAL FLOOD INSURANCE AVAILABILITY. This is a review of community eligibility; it does not address individual building related eligibility, that is reviewed in the insurance process. Check all boxes that apply; Note that boxes 1 (Federal Flood Insurance is available ...) and 2 (Federal Flood Insurance is not available ...) are mutually exclusive. In most instances, Federal flood insurance is available to all residents with eligible property in a community that participates in the NFIP. Community participation status can be determined by consulting the NFIP Community Status Book, which is available from FEMA and at http://www.fema.gov/fema/csb.shtm . The NFIP Community Status Book will indicate whether or not the community is participating in the NFIP and whether participation is in the Emergency or Regular Program. If the community participates in the NFIP, check either Regular Program or Emergency Program. To obtain Federal flood insurance, a copy of this completed form may be provided to an insurance agent.
Federal flood insurance is prohibited in areas designated by the Coastal Barrier Resources Act to be in a Coastal Barrier Resources Area (CBRA) and Otherwise Protected Areas (OPA) for buildings or mobile homes built or substantially improved after the date of the CBRA or OPA designation. Information about the Coastal Barrier Resources System (CBRS) may be obtained by visiting the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's website at http://www.fws.gov/CBRA/index.html.
D. DETERMINATION. If any portion of the building/mobile home is in an identified Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA), check yes (flood insurance is required). If no portion of the building/mobile home is in an identified SFHA, check no. If no NFIP map exists for the community, check no. If no NFIP map exists, Section B5 should also be checked.
E. COMMENTS. Optional Comment. Preparer may add additional comments/pages/data as needed.
